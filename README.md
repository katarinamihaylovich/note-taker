# note-taker

## Description

The purpose of this project was to present an application consisting of a home page and a functional link to a notes page so that a user would be able to write and save notes. I wanted to create this project to demonstrate, via express, how front- and back-end development work together via middleware. I was given starter code and created an index.js file that would function as my server. The only other file created was an fsUtils.js file in the "helpers" folder. My goal was to create a way for users to add, read, and delete notes. I did this by establishing various routes between files by incorporating the assistance of uuid and express.js. I learned more about how files interact with one another through the use of express, how uuid creates unique and necessary ids, and how ports work.
